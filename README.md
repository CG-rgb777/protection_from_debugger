# protection_from_debugger
Honestly, I'm new to programming, and although the name of the program is ultimate_protect_from_debuggers, the protection isn't that cool. There are many more ways to hook the debugger into the process, but I guess I'll figure out how to protect against them someday. There is also a very weak defense against intercepting data sent from the server (and it will work if the attacker uses wireshark and it doesn't occur to him to rename the executable :D). There are also traps that are not activated by themselves in any way, only if someone curious tries to make the program not terminate by itself, and if they try to disable the traps or protection threads, they will have more traps waiting for them :D. Also in the code there is a function “protection_started_check”, if it is disabled, then the “last wall of protection” will be activated, if it is activated the attacker's computer will be shut down. And if the attacker's OS is undefined, the file will simply be deleted (I think it's worth cutting this function).

For better protection, it's better not to use exec and eval, but if you really need them, just remove lines 14 and 15 from the code.
